## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run without issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

The intent of this notebook is to analyze the locality of hosts (i.e. host lives in the same neighbourhood as the listing object) on prices and room types of the listings.

### Questions answered in the following:
- what is the average price of listings per neighbourhood?
- do local hosts charge more for their object than average?
- can we succesfully increase the number of matched hosts?
- do local hosts offer more private rooms than other hosts?
- do private rooms tend to be cheaper?

## File Descriptions

The whole process is gathered in the notebook found in this directory. Detailed description regarding the code can be found in markdown cells and comments contained in the notebook.

## Results

Most of the results can be found in the notebook. Additional information and formatted results can be found in my Medium post [here](https://spreuhs.medium.com/host-locality-effects-in-berlin-abe48349994b).
